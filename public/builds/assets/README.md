### grandGruntjs, is a SPA using bootstrap, sass, npm, bower, grunt, package.json, and JavaScript

### dest folder is => public/builds/

### new startup-page for workfolder
> this time to include sass ready files.


- removed angular(for this project), and suzy(forever)
- updated Gruntfile.js, package.json,bower.json,config.rb and Gemfile 
- rebuild navigation, and made some changes to page layout.
- added some html5 elements
- added skip navigation with javascript(recommended when navigation
  comes before main content)
- sticky footer classes for short pages and a javascript function,in 
  case for some reason it stops working on screen resizing.
- added a few partials, compass mixes for a more modular look :)
- added a secondary font and moved google fonts from index page to 
  sass folders.
- adding all of the files (cause if you clone this folder and then run npm etc... and don't have latest RVN files 
  installed, then you need to update prior to running grunt)
